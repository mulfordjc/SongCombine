twosongshift.py

Takes 2 songs and determines the ideal transition between them if tempo is ignored.

This script was altered on 04/04/2015 to be called by another class, and returns the ideal transition instead of writing it to a file

Usage: python twosongshift.py <first_filename> <second_filename> <ratio> <output_file>

Example: python twosongshift.py CallMeMaybe.mp3 ShakeItOff.mp3 .33 Transitions.txt

This will determine the transitions between the segments .33 of each side from the middle of CallMeMaybe.mp3 and ShakeItOff.mp3, and will put the
best transition into Transitions.txt.  Transitions.txt will hold 2 integers.
The first integer will be the segment in CallMeMaybe.mp3, and the second integer will be the
segment in ShakeItOff.mp3.
